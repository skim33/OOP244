If self-assignment is neglected, the deallocation statement releases the memory holding the resource data, which would result in a loss of access to the source resource. This is why the check for self-assignment should be done at first.

2
The use of member functions repeatedly where possible.

Learning outcomes in completing this workshop are as follows:

How a copy constructor works
How an assignment operator works
How to implement a deallocation of dynamically allocated memory where necessary
