No because if data, relation, or whatever actions handled is part of derived classes, it should be handled in the base class without checking the actual type.

Yes. Since a derived class inherits the entire structure of its base class, it should know about the existence of its base class. In order for a member function of a derived class to access the base class version of a member function, scope resolution is used. This is where the word "Hero" appear in the SuperHero.cpp. 

3
"Ancient Battle!". When a Hero fight a SuperHero, a member function of the base class is used.

Quiz 6 Reflection:
Q2. wrong: data members -> correct: member functions
Q3. wrong: ACDB -> correct: AACDBB
Q4. Needed to add two more lines of code ->  Derived b(num) in main function; 
				        Derived (int num): Base(num);
