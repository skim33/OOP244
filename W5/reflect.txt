In general, an operator like operator+ whose result is a new value should
return the new value by value. On the other hand, a modifier operator like
operator+= should return a reference to the modified value.

2
a, b, c, d, e

In order to minimize code dupulication, I reused my functions wherever possible.
For example, whenever validation is needed, I used isEmpty() function. In addtion,
I also tried to use the ternary operator whenever the conditional operator is needed.

4
In this workshop, I learned how to make use of operators. To be specific,
I learned how to overload an operator as a member function of a class. I got to know
how operators work, which I wasn't very sure about before working on this workshop.
